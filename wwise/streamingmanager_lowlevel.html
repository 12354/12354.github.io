 The Low-Level I/O is a submodule of the default implementation of the high-level Stream Manager's API, which serves to provide an interface for I/O transfers that you will find much simpler to implement than the high-level Stream Manager API. It is therefore only relevant in the context of the default implementation of the Stream Manager. </td></tr>

Introduction</h1>
<p>The Low-Level I/O system is specific to Audiokinetic's implementation of the Stream Manager. Its interfaces are defined in <em>&lt;Wwise Installation&gt;/SDK/include/AK/SoundEngine/AkStreamMgrModule.h</em>.</p>
<p>The Low-Level I/O system has two purposes:</p><ul>
<li>Resolving file location.</li>
<li>Abstracting actual I/O transfers.</li>
</ul>
<p>One and only one object that implements <a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_file_location_resolver.html">AK::StreamMgr::IAkFileLocationResolver</a>, referred to as the File Location Resolver, must be registered to the Stream Manager (using <code><a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_ab5c2340963ac5ff81e49969b74ef2520.html#ab5c2340963ac5ff81e49969b74ef2520">AK::StreamMgr::SetFileLocationResolver()</a></code>). To open a standard or automatic stream, the Stream Manager will call <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_file_location_resolver_a5c7515d84fe8b7ce1e1c06690447673d.html#a5c7515d84fe8b7ce1e1c06690447673d">AK::StreamMgr::IAkFileLocationResolver::GetNextPreferredDevice()</a></code> to find which streaming device is likely to have the file. Streaming devices are created and registered in the Stream Manager using <code><a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_a64a22d377d25137222fbb66ff21965d5.html#a64a22d377d25137222fbb66ff21965d5">AK::StreamMgr::CreateDevice()</a></code>.</p>
<p>For each streaming device, a low-level I/O hook must be provided. This I/O hook implements <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_low_level_i_o_hook.html">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook</a></code> and is responsible for communicating with the platform's I/O API and handles the unique properties and behavior of that physical device. Whenever a streaming device needs to perform an I/O transfer, it calls the low-level I/O hook's <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_low_level_i_o_hook_a9bc325405bc17c0a5105d0a53981b186.html#a9bc325405bc17c0a5105d0a53981b186">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook::BatchRead()</a></code>, or <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_low_level_i_o_hook_a8f5041a24e395784437a62cdd2140505.html#a8f5041a24e395784437a62cdd2140505">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook::BatchWrite()</a></code> method. No direct call to a platform's I/O API is ever issued from the High-Level Stream Manager. Together, the File Location Resolver and I/O hooks constitute the Low-Level I/O system.</p>
<p>The following figure illustrates the Low-Level I/O system interfaces and how they are viewed by the default Stream Manager.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="LowLevelIO.gif" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>Game titles need to implement Low-Level I/O interfaces to resolve file location and perform actual I/O transfers. The easiest and most efficient way to integrate the Wwise sound engine's I/O management in your game is to use the default implementation of the Stream Manager and implement a Low-Level I/O system. From there, you can perform native file reads, or you can route the I/O requests to your own I/O management technology.</p>
<p>Wwise's SDK includes default implementations for the Low-Level I/O. It can be used as is, or as a starting point to implement your own. Refer to the <a class="el" href="streamingmanager_lowlevel.html#streamingmanager_lowlevel_default_implementation_walkthrough">Sample Default Implementation Walkthrough</a> section for a detailed overview of the Low-Level I/O samples.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="streamingmanager_lowlevel_location"></a>
File Location Resolving</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="streamingmanager_lowlevel_location_filelocationresolver"></a>
File Location Resolver</h2>
<p>A File Location Resolver needs to be registered to the Stream Manager using <code><a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_ab5c2340963ac5ff81e49969b74ef2520.html#ab5c2340963ac5ff81e49969b74ef2520">AK::StreamMgr::SetFileLocationResolver()</a></code>. Whenever the Stream Manager creates a stream object, it calls this resolver's GetNextPreferredDevice() method and it should return the AkDeviceID that identifies the I/O Device to use to open the file. The purpose of this function is to find the file location only from its name, flags, language, etc. without performing a disk operation or other physical check. The real Open call will be forwarded to the specified device to perform the disk operation. Therefore, this function is expected to return quickly. If the Device fails to find or open the file, GetNextPreferredDevice will be called again. If no other Devices are known, or the file is unlikely to be found in other locations, then AK_FileNotFound should be returned to notify the end of the search.</p>
<p>The same number of files exist simultaneously in the Low-Level I/O as stream objects in the Stream Manager.</p>
<p>The game must create at least one streaming device in the Stream Manager using <code><a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_a64a22d377d25137222fbb66ff21965d5.html#a64a22d377d25137222fbb66ff21965d5">AK::StreamMgr::CreateDevice()</a></code>. The returned AkDeviceID should be kept by the caller and returned in <code>AK::StreamMgr::GetNextPreferredDevice</code> as described above. It may however create as many devices as required. Each streaming device runs in its own thread, and sends I/O requests to its own I/O hook. Typically, you should create one streaming device per physical device. In the <a class="el" href="struct_ak_file_desc.html">AkFileDesc</a> structure, there is a field called deviceID. The File Location Resolver needs to set it to the deviceID of one of the streaming devices that were created. This is how file handling is dispatched to the appropriate device. Additionally, the file's size and offset (<code>uSector</code>) must be returned, and a system file handle should be created (although this is not strictly necessary).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="streamingmanager_lowlevel_location_filedesc"></a>
File Description</h2>
<p>Clients of the Stream Manager identify files either using strings (const AkOSChar *), IDs (AkFileID, integer), or file descriptors (<a class="el" href="struct_ak_file_desc.html">AkFileDesc</a>). This is why the stream creation methods of the Stream Manager (<code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_i_ak_stream_mgr_a1de2a7935a2d3cddb71e7cc7f48effd6.html#a1de2a7935a2d3cddb71e7cc7f48effd6">AK::IAkStreamMgr::CreateStd()</a></code>, <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_i_ak_stream_mgr_afe30a576bd859ff4e9b60a3f8e1710fb.html#afe30a576bd859ff4e9b60a3f8e1710fb">AK::IAkStreamMgr::CreateAuto()</a></code>) use a struct call <a class="el" href="struct_ak_file_open_data.html">AkFileOpenData</a> that groups both possible file identification methods. The <code><a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_sound_engine_1_1_dynamic_sequence_ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690.html#ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook::Open()</a></code> method must create a valid file descriptor, once the file is opened.</p>
<p>This file descriptor is passed back in every call to methods of the low-level I/O hooks. Three members of the structure are used by the High-Level Stream Manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>deviceID: Needs to be a valid device ID acquired from a call to <code><a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_a64a22d377d25137222fbb66ff21965d5.html#a64a22d377d25137222fbb66ff21965d5">AK::CreateDevice()</a></code>. It is used by the Stream Manager to associate the file to the proper high-level device. Once the association is made, I/O transfers are executed through the I/O hook that was passed when creating the device.</li>
<li>uSector: The offset of the beginning of the described file. This is relative to the beginning of the file represented by the AkFileHandle <code><a class="el" href="struct_ak_file_desc_ad8ff92ae5cb0cb666d77688189f5ef3f.html#ad8ff92ae5cb0cb666d77688189f5ef3f" title="File handle/identifier.">AkFileDesc::hFile</a></code>. It is expressed in terms of blocks (sectors), which size corresponds to the value returned by <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_low_level_i_o_hook_a5018552d455ddc2a95b727fc543aac9e.html#a5018552d455ddc2a95b727fc543aac9e">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook::GetBlockSize()</a></code> for this file descriptor. When the streaming device calls a method for I/O transfer, it sends the offset (in bytes) from the beginning of the file to its low-level I/O hook as part of the AkTransferInfo structure. The offset is computed this way: Current_Position + ( <a class="el" href="struct_ak_file_desc_a3fc9acc74908496f0966c75b41b8e61e.html#a3fc9acc74908496f0966c75b41b8e61e">AkFileDesc::uSector</a> * Block_Size). Note that the block size is also queried through this hook, once for each file descriptor.</li>
<li>iFileSize: Used by the Stream Manager to detect the end of file. It can then report it back to users (through <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_i_ak_std_stream_a7d43a89fb7bc5db13285a2669ec912fa.html#a7d43a89fb7bc5db13285a2669ec912fa">AK::IAkStdStream::GetPosition()</a></code>, <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_i_ak_auto_stream_ae7fa6bd56c493b906e294618b47be39e.html#ae7fa6bd56c493b906e294618b47be39e">AK::IAkAutoStream::GetPosition()</a></code>) and stop automatic streams' I/O transfers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining members are owned exclusively by the Low-Level I/O system. For example, <code>AkFileHandle</code>, which is typedefined to HANDLE in Win32, can be used to hold an actual valid file handle that is passed to Win32's <code>ReadFile()</code>. However, it can also be used as an ID, or a pointer. High-level devices never modify or read file descriptor fields. Thus, the Low-Level I/O is free to close and reopen a file handle, for example, if files have been laid out redundantly on the game disk.</p>
<p>The file descriptor structure that is returned by <code><a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_sound_engine_1_1_dynamic_sequence_ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690.html#ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook::Open()</a></code> needs to remains the same throughout the lifetime of its associated stream object, until <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_low_level_i_o_hook_a7a50a7a5fa624691d7bb7608753dc096.html#a7a50a7a5fa624691d7bb7608753dc096">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook::Close()</a></code> is called.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="streamingmanager_lowlevel_location_deferred_open"></a>
Deferred Opening</h2>
<p>All file open operations carried out by <code><a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_sound_engine_1_1_dynamic_sequence_ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690.html#ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook::Open()</a></code> can be synchronous or deferred. If the native API of the device supports deferred opening, it is always better to use it for performance reasons. This way the file open and read/write operations might be carried out in parallel, or prioritized differently, on certain systems.</p>
<p>The parameter to <a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_sound_engine_1_1_dynamic_sequence_ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690.html#ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690">Open()</a> is an <a class="el" href="struct_ak_async_file_open_data.html">AkAsyncFileOpenData</a> struct which derives from <a class="el" href="struct_ak_file_open_data.html">AkFileOpenData</a> that contains all the information passed from the <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_i_ak_stream_mgr_a1de2a7935a2d3cddb71e7cc7f48effd6.html#a1de2a7935a2d3cddb71e7cc7f48effd6">AK::IAkStreamMgr::CreateStd()</a></code> or <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_i_ak_stream_mgr_afe30a576bd859ff4e9b60a3f8e1710fb.html#afe30a576bd859ff4e9b60a3f8e1710fb">AK::IAkStreamMgr::CreateAuto()</a></code> functions. It also contains a callback function necessary to notify the completion of the Open operation to the high-level Streaming Manager and the return <code><a class="el" href="struct_ak_file_desc.html">AkFileDesc</a></code> structure to fill out.</p>
<p>There are two modes of operation to consider when implementing <code><a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_sound_engine_1_1_dynamic_sequence_ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690.html#ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook::Open()</a></code>: asynchronous and synchronous.</p>
<p>If the operation is asynchronous, set up what is necessary to dispatch the Open operation and then return AK_Deferred. This signals that the result of the operation will come through the notification callback (io_pOpenData-&gt;pCallback). It is imperative to notify of the result once it is known, otherwise the stream object waiting for this file will stay alive indefinitely, using up memory and probably cause a memory leak. If the result reported by io_pOpenData-&gt;pCallback is AK_Success, it is expected that (io_pOpenData-&gt;pFileDesc) is filled properly and usable.</p>

File System Flags</h2>
<p>The Stream Manager's <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_i_ak_stream_mgr_a1de2a7935a2d3cddb71e7cc7f48effd6.html#a1de2a7935a2d3cddb71e7cc7f48effd6">AK::IAkStreamMgr::CreateStd()</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_i_ak_stream_mgr_afe30a576bd859ff4e9b60a3f8e1710fb.html#afe30a576bd859ff4e9b60a3f8e1710fb">AK::IAkStreamMgr::CreateAuto()</a></code> methods accept a pointer to an <a class="el" href="struct_ak_file_system_flags.html" title="File system flags for file descriptors mapping.">AkFileSystemFlags</a> structure, which is passed to <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_file_location_resolver_a5c7515d84fe8b7ce1e1c06690447673d.html#a5c7515d84fe8b7ce1e1c06690447673d">AK::StreamMgr::IAkFileLocationResolver::GetNextPreferredDevice()</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_sound_engine_1_1_dynamic_sequence_ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690.html#ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook::Open()</a></code>. This structure is a way to pass information directly from the users to the Low-Level I/O. This information is used to complete the file location logic, for example. Generic users of the Stream Manager can pass NULL, but the sound engine always passes a structure filled with relevant information, so that the File Location Resolver knows that a request comes from the sound engine.</p>
<p>The file system flag structure contains the following fields:</p><ul>
<li>uCompanyID: the sound engine always sets this field to AKCOMPANYID_AUDIOKINETIC, so the implementer of the Low-Level I/O knows that this file must be read by the sound engine. The sound engine passes AKCOMPANYID_AUDIOKINETIC_EXTERNAL in the case of streamed external sources.</li>
<li>uCodecID: this field can be used to distinguish between file types. It is needed for file types used by the sound engine. The codec IDs used by the sound engine are defined in AkTypes.h. The host program may also define its own IDs with the same values, as long as it does not set the companyID to AKCOMPANYID_AUDIOKINETIC or AKCOMPANYID_AUDIOKINETIC_EXTERNAL. Note the predefined CodecID AKCODECID_BANK, AKCODECID_BANK_EVENT, AKCODECID_BANK_BUS which, on top of the traditional Codecs, can be useful for file organization.</li>
<li>bIsLanguageSpecific: this field indicates whether the file being looked up is specific to the current language. Typically, a file that has language-specific content exists in different locations (language folders typically). The Low-Level I/O needs to resolve the path according to the language currently selected. See <a class="el" href="soundengine_banks_general.html#soundengine_banks_general_identification_language">Language-Specific ("Voice" and "Mixed") Soundbanks</a> for more details.</li>
<li>Custom parameter and size: Used for game-specific extensions of the file location scheme. For example, extensions can be copied in the file descriptor. The sound engine always passes 0.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="streamingmanager_lowlevel_location_resolution"></a>
Resolution of the Sound Engine Files</h2>
<p>The sound engine reads SoundBank files and streamed audio files. This subsection explains how the Low-Level I/O can resolve their identifiers to actual files.</p>
<p>Different strategies exist to map the ID received in <a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_sound_engine_1_1_dynamic_sequence_ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690.html#ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook::Open()</a> to a valid file descriptor in the Low-Level I/O:</p><ul>
<li>implement and use a map of IDs to file names</li>
<li>create file name strings out of IDs</li>
<li>get the system handle of a big file that concatenates all streamed audio files (for e.g. a file package generated with the File Packager application - refer to the Wwise Help for more details), and implement and use a map of IDs to file descriptor structures that define their size and offset in this big file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SDK samples of the Low-Level I/O resolve file location using two different strategies. One of them (<b>CAkFileLocationBase</b>) concatenates paths, set globally, to create a full path string that can be used with platform <code>fopen()</code> methods. The other one (<code><b>CAkFilePackageLowLevelIO</b></code>) manages a file package that was created with the File Packager utility. A file package is simply a big file in which many files are concatenated, with a header that indicates the relative offset of each original file.</p>
<p>Implementations of File Location Resolvers are provided as SDK samples. They use a different strategy to manage file location. These strategies are described in the sample code walkthroughs, at the end of this section.</p>
<p>Refer to <a class="el" href="streamingmanager_lowlevel.html#streamingmanager_lowlevel_default_implementation_walkthrough_file_location">Basic File Location</a> for a description of the strategy used by the default implementations of the Low-Level I/O.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="streamingmanager_lowlevel_location_soundbanks"></a>
SoundBanks</h3>
<p>Following an explicit or implicit request to load a bank from the main API (<code><a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_sound_engine_a95f8f6841a618ec3d5e51a30a1614e13.html#a95f8f6841a618ec3d5e51a30a1614e13">AK::SoundEngine::LoadBank()</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_sound_engine_a2e6ebb779470b43d78984c27f6a0c238.html#a2e6ebb779470b43d78984c27f6a0c238">AK::SoundEngine::PrepareEvent()</a></code>), the Bank Manager of the sound engine may call either the ANSI string or the ID overload of <a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_i_ak_stream_mgr_a1de2a7935a2d3cddb71e7cc7f48effd6.html#a1de2a7935a2d3cddb71e7cc7f48effd6">AK::IAkStreamMgr::CreateStd()</a>.

It is up to your implementation of the Low-Level I/O to resolve this.

I/O Transfer Interface</h1>
<p>Once file location has been resolved, the Stream Manager hands the file descriptor to the appropriate streaming device, which interacts with the Low-Level I/O system through its own I/O hook. The first thing it does is to query the low-level block size constraint, by calling <a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_low_level_i_o_hook_a5018552d455ddc2a95b727fc543aac9e.html#a5018552d455ddc2a95b727fc543aac9e">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook::GetBlockSize()</a>. Then, every input data transfer is executed through the hook's Read() method, and output through the hook's Write() method. When the stream is destroyed, <a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_low_level_i_o_hook_a7a50a7a5fa624691d7bb7608753dc096.html#a7a50a7a5fa624691d7bb7608753dc096">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook::Close()</a> is called.</p>

High-Level Devices Specificity</h2>
<p>The current implementation of the Stream Manager defines a single type of I/O hook, which uses asynchronous handshaking with the Low-Level I/O.</p>

Basic File Location</h2>
<p>Files used by the sound engine are opened either with IDs (used for both streamed audio files and SoundBanks) or with strings (generally reserved for SoundBanks). <b>CAkDefaultIOHookDeferred</b> inherit from <b>CAkFileLocationBase</b>, which exposes methods to set global paths (<b>SetBasePath()</b>, <b>AddBasePath()</b>, <b>SetBankPath()</b>, <b>SetAudioSrcPath()</b>). Both overloads of <b>CAkDefaultIOHookDeferred::Open()</b> call <b>CAkFileLocationBase::GetFullFilePath()</b>, to create a full file name that can be used with native file open functions. The base path is prepended first. Then, if the file is a SoundBank, the SoundBank path is added. If it is a streamed audio file, the audio source path is added. In both cases, if it is a file with a location dependent on the current language, the language directory name is added.</p>
<p>If the string overload is used, the file name string is appended to this path.</p>
<p>In the ID overload, only Audiokinetic’s file IDs are resolved. A game that uses the ID overload needs to change the implementation according to its ID mapping scheme. The mapping scheme of <b>CAkFileLocationBase</b> is the following: it creates a string based on the file ID, and appends an extension that depends on the file type (specified with the Codec ID). This is compatible with the streamed files naming convention used by the "Copy Streamed Files" post-generation step soundbank setting. Refer to the Wwise Help for more information about the soundbank settings.</p>

Deferred I/O Hook Walkthrough</h2>
<p>Generally, asynchronous file read APIs on platforms require that you pass a platform-specific structure to fread() (OVERLAPPED on Windows), and keep it for the whole duration of the I/O operation, until a callback function gets called to notify you that I/O is complete.</p>
<p>The implementation is somewhat similar on all platforms. <b>CAkDefaultIOHookDeferred</b> allocates an array of these platform-specific structures in its own memory pool. When <b>CAkDefaultIOHookDeferred::Read()</b> is called, it finds the first structure that is free, marks it as "used", fills it with the information provided in <a class="el" href="struct_ak_async_i_o_transfer_info.html">AkAsyncIOTransferInfo</a>, and passes it to fread(). It also passes a local static callback function whose signature is compatible with the platform's asynchronous fread() function. In this function, it determines if the operation was successful, releases the platform-specific I/O structure, and calls back the streaming device.</p>
<p>Obtaining and releasing the platform-specific I/O structure from the array must be atomic, as we need to avoid race conditions between Read()/Write() and the system's callback.</p>
<p>Some platforms expose a service to cancel I/O requests that were already sent to the kernel. When this is the case, it is called from within <b>CAkDefaultIOHookDeferred::Cancel()</b>. On Windows, <b>CancelIO()</b> cancels all requests for a given file handle. Therefore, we must ensure that the streaming device wants to cancel all requests for a given file before calling this function, by looking at the argument io_bCancelAllTransfersForThisFile. If it doesn't, then Cancel() does nothing: we just wait until requests are complete. The streaming device knows which ones it needs to discard.</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<td valign="top"><img src="images/Caution.gif" alt="" class="inline"/></td><td><b>Caution:</b> Do not cancel requests that were not cancelled explicitly by the streaming device. If you do, you may end up feeding it with invalid or corrupted data, which may crash the sound engine. </td></tr>

Multi-Device I/O System</h2>
<p>The following figure represents a multi-device I/O system.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="LowLevelIO_MultiDevices.gif" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>What you need to do to work with multiple streaming devices is to instantiate and register a File Location Resolver that is distinct from the device's low-level I/O hooks. The purpose of this object is to dispatch files to the appropriate device. The strategy you employ to decide which device handles which files is yours to define. You may use <b>CAkDefaultLowLevelIODispatcher</b> as a canvas. The default implementation uses brute force: each device is asked to open the file until one of them succeeds. Thus these devices must also implement the <a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_file_location_resolver.html">AK::StreamMgr::IAkFileLocationResolver</a> interface. It can be any of the samples provided in the SDK:</p><ul>
<li>CAkDefaultIOHookDeferred</li>
<li>CAkFilePackageIOHookDeferred</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how you would instantiate both a deferred device and a file package device in a multi-device system (although this example is not useful in practice).</p>

Sample File Package Low-Level I/O Implementation Walkthrough</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="streamingmanager_lowlevel_filepackage_implementation_walkthrough_intro"></a>
General Description</h2>
<p>The <b>CAkFilePackageLowLevelIO&lt;&gt;</b> class is a layer above the Default low-level I/O hooks. It extends the latter by being able to load a file that was generated by the sample File Packager (see <a class="el" href="samplecode.html#samplecode_integration_filepackager">File Packager Utility</a>). It uses a more advanced strategy to resolve the IDs into file descriptors. File packages are composed of many concatenated files (streamed audio files and bank files), and their header contains information about these files.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a class="el" href="samplecode.html#samplecode_integration_filepackagelowlevelio">File Package Low-Level I/O Implementation</a> for the sample code. You can use the File Package Low-Level I/O "as-is" (<b>CAkFilePackageLowLevelIODeferred</b>), along with its counterpart, the File Packager utility. Or, simply consider them as a proof of concept for the implementation of an advanced file location resolving method.</p>
<p>The File Package Low-Level I/O exposes the method <b>CAkFilePackageLowLevelIO::LoadFilePackage()</b>, whose argument is the file name of a package that was generated with the sample File Packager. It opens it using the services of the default implementation, then parses the header and builds the look-up tables. You may load as many file packages as you want. <b>LoadFilePackage()</b> returns an ID that you can use with <b>UnloadFilePackage()</b> to unload it.</p>
<p>The class <b>CAkFilePackage</b> represents a loaded file package, and all data structures and code to handle file look-up is defined in class <b>CAkFilePackageLUT</b>. The <b>CAkFilePackageLowLevelIO&lt;&gt;</b> class overrides some of the methods of the default I/O hooks, to invoke the look-up services of <b>CAkFilePackageLUT</b>. When a file descriptor is not found, or when the request does not concern a file descriptor that belongs to the file package, then the default implementation is called.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="streamingmanager_lowlevel_filepackage_implementation_walkthrough_filelocation"></a>
File Location</h2>
<p>The idea behind file look-up inside packages is the following: you get a file handle from the platform's file open function only once, and then at each call to <a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_sound_engine_1_1_dynamic_sequence_ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690.html#ae1255816f8ed9f3e1020f2075f12c690">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook::Open()</a>, you simply return a file descriptor that uses this file handle, but with an offset that corresponds to the offset of the original file inside the file package (using the uSector field of the file descriptor <a class="el" href="struct_ak_file_desc.html">AkFileDesc</a>). This also has the benefit of allowing more control over the placement of files on disk.</p>
<p>The File Packager utility carefully prepares its header so that the Low-Level I/O only has to cast some pointers to obtain the look-up tables it contains, that is, one for the streamed audio files, and one for the bank files. Look-up tables are arrays of the following structure:</p>

<p>The File Package low-level I/O uses the uCustomParamSize field of the file descriptor to store the block size. This has 2 purposes:</p><ul>
<li>easy access to its block size;</li>
<li>distinguish file descriptors that belong to the file package (uCustomParamSize == 0 means that the file was not found in the package).

Managing Languages</h2>
<p>Since Wwise version 2011.2, the current language is set on the default Stream Manager module, using <a class="el" href="namespace_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_ae4820886baae734dd90177a49a2be1eb.html#ae4820886baae734dd90177a49a2be1eb">AK::StreamMgr::SetCurrentLanguage()</a>, defined in <a class="el" href="_ak_stream_mgr_module_8h.html">AkStreamMgrModule.h</a>. Pass the name of the language, <b>without a trailing slash or backslash</b>.</p>
<p>The default low-level I/O implementations inheriting from <b>CAkFileLocationBase</b> get the language name from the Stream Manager, and append it to the base path. The language name should therefore correspond to the name of the directory where are stored localized assets for this particular language.</p>
<p>File packages generated by the File Packager utility may contain one or many versions of the same asset in different languages. Their header contains a string map of language names. The File Package Low-Level I/O listens to language changes on the Stream Manager, and uses the current language name to look-up the correct localized version of packaged localized assets. </p>
