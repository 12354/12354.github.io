<div class="textblock"><p>At any moment in a game, you can have many sounds playing at the same time, even to the point where more sounds will be triggered than the hardware can handle. To effectively manage the number of sounds that are played, you must determine how many sounds can play simultaneously and which sounds take priority.</p>
<p>In Wwise, there are two main properties that can help you determine which sounds will be played in game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Playback limit â€” Specifies a limit to the number of sound instances that can be played at any one time.</li>
<li>Playback priority â€” Specifies the importance of one sound object relative to another.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the number of triggered sounds exceeds the playback limit, sounds are killed starting with those that have the lowest playback priority.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can set sounds to use virtual voice settings when the playback limit is reached. These settings include the option to continue playing a sound when it's over the limit. However, when too many sounds have their virtual behavior set to <b>Continue to play</b>, you might end up in situations where performance is affected.</p>
<p>These advanced playback settings are defined within Wwise by the sound designer. For more information on specifying these Advanced Settings and how they affect playback, refer to <b>Defining the Advanced Properties for Objects and Busses</b> in the <b>Adding Flavor to Your Sounds : Managing the Priority of Sounds</b> section of the Wwise documentation. </p>
