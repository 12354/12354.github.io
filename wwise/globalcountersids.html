<td>PreparedEventsMemory</td><td>The amount of memory used for the prepared events. When an Event is prepared, only the media specifically associated with that Event gets loaded into memory. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ProfilerBandwidth</td><td>The volume of profiling data sent by the game to the Wwise authoring application. Units: KB/s (kilobytes per second). </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>RegisteredObjects</td><td>The number of game objects registered at any one time. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>SpatialAudioCPU</td><td>The total amount of CPU used by spatial audio, expressed as a percentage of an audio frame. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>SpatialAudioComputedEdges</td><td>The number of diffraction edges that have been processed during this frame. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>SpatialAudioDiffractionEdges</td><td>The total number of diffraction edges in the current 3D environment. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>SpatialAudioEmitters</td><td>The number of emitters processed by spatial audio: for each emitter spatial audio validates the reflection and diffraction paths. </td></tr>
