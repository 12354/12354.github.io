Wwise SDK 2023.1.0</h1>
<p>WwiseÂ® is a comprehensive audio middleware solution for game development designed to create sophisticated and rich interactive audio. It consists of an authoring application and sound engine that are tightly integrated, giving sound designers and programmers the power to achieve awe-inspiring audio more affordably and in less time.</p>
<p>The Wwise sound engine consists of two sections: a cross-platform behavioral level that handles a comprehensive set of functionalities and a low level section that has been highly optimized for each platform. The sound engine was developed with ease of integration in mind making it simple to take full advantage of advanced audio features within your games.</p>
