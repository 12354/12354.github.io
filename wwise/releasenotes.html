New Features</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>WG-29468</b> Added support for up to 255 Effects per object.</li>
<li><b>WG-39278</b> (WAAPI) Added support for Work Units in <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_object_delete.html">ak.wwise.core.object.delete</a>, <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_object_move.html">ak.wwise.core.object.move</a>, <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_object_copy.html">ak.wwise.core.object.copy</a>, <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_object_create.html">ak.wwise.core.object.create</a>, and <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_object_set.html">ak.wwise.core.object.set</a>.</li>
<li><b>WG-42230</b> (Spatial Audio) Diffraction paths are now found across corners as well as edges. This significantly reduces incidents of paths cutting in/out abruptly as objects go behind barriers and results in smoother audio output.</li>
<li><b>WG-44681</b> (WAAPI) Music Switch Containers can now be created and organized with WAAPI using <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_object_set.html">ak.wwise.core.object.set</a>.</li>
<li><b>WG-47295</b> (WAAPI) Rewrote the Sequence Container object model using object lists, which makes the sequence available through WAAPI.</li>
<li><b>WG-52539</b> Added new functions to the IAkPluginServiceMixer interface allowing plug-ins to use the existing high-performance biquad filter functionality available in Wwise instead of a custom-made solution.</li>
<li><b>WG-53279</b> Added a lightweight solution to the Reflect plug-in to suppress phasing issues caused by interference between reflections and the direct sound.</li>
<li><b>WG-54869</b> (WAAPI) <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_object_set.html">ak.wwise.core.object.set</a> now supports importing audio files on multiple object types, including Work Units, Virtual Folders, Containers, Sounds, Audio File Sources, Music Segments, Source plug-ins, and Effect plug-ins.</li>
<li><b>WG-57314</b> Added Motion and Reflect plug-ins to the Integration Demo. It was also modified to allow other plug-in demos in the future.</li>
<li><b>WG-57421</b> (WAAPI) Added function <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_profiler_savecapture.html">ak.wwise.core.profiler.saveCapture</a> to save profiler captures.</li>
<li><b>WG-58608</b> (WAAPI) Added source control API. Refer to <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_sourcecontrol_add.html">ak.wwise.core.sourceControl.add</a>, <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_sourcecontrol_checkout.html">ak.wwise.core.sourceControl.checkOut</a>, <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_sourcecontrol_commit.html">ak.wwise.core.sourceControl.commit</a>, <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_sourcecontrol_delete.html">ak.wwise.core.sourceControl.delete</a>, <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_sourcecontrol_getsourcefiles.html">ak.wwise.core.sourceControl.getSourceFiles</a>, <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_sourcecontrol_getstatus.html">ak.wwise.core.sourceControl.getStatus</a>, <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_sourcecontrol_move.html">ak.wwise.core.sourceControl.move</a>, <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_sourcecontrol_revert.html">ak.wwise.core.sourceControl.revert</a>, and <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_sourcecontrol_setprovider.html">ak.wwise.core.sourceControl.setProvider</a>.</li>
<li><b>WG-58676</b> (WAAPI) Introduced a JSON anonymous object accessor in the return options to group properties by object.</li>
<li><b>WG-59020</b> Steering panner can now output to ambisonic busses.</li>
<li><b>WG-59482</b> (Spatial Audio) The Wwise Spatial Audio library can now perform room containment calculations internally. Previously, it was necessary for you to assign a Game Object to a Room using the <code>AK::SpatialAudio::SetGameObjectInRoom</code> API. Now, this containment calculation can be performed automatically as long as each Room is assigned geometry using the <code>AkRoomParams::GeometryInstanceID</code>. If you want to override the internal Room containment calculation, call <code>AK::SpatialAudio::SetGameObjectInRoom</code>, and Wwise will cease to update the Room automatically for the specified Game Object. You can then call <code>AK::SpatialAudio::UnsetGameObjectInRoom</code> to resume internal Room containment calculation. A new member, <code>AkRoomParams::RoomPriority</code>, has been added to <code><a class="el" href="struct_ak_room_params.html" title="Parameters passed to SetRoom.">AkRoomParams</a></code>. It is used by the internal Room containment algorithm to determine which Room to assign to a Game Object when it is physically located inside two Rooms (for example, a Room inside another Room). In this case, the room with the higher priority is assigned.</li>
<li><b>WG-59684</b> Clicking the Display options button in the Capture Log, Audio Object 3D Viewer, and Game Object 3D Viewer now opens the options in a separate view.</li>
<li><b>WG-60166</b> (WAAPI) Added support in return options to chain several accessors that return multiple objects. For example, children.name</li>
<li><b>WG-60274</b> (WAAPI) Improved the user experience when using source control with WAAPI.</li>
<li><b>WG-60358</b> Listener and emitter room assignments are now automatically computed by Wwise. The automatically assigned room can be overridden by a call to <code>SetGameObjectInRoom</code> or re-enabled by a call to <code>UnsetGameObjectInRoom</code>.</li>
<li><b>WG-60615</b> (WAAPI) Added new function to expose source control operations.</li>
<li><b>WG-60616</b> (WAAPI/WAQL) Added new accessors: mediaId, conversionHash, and contentHash.</li>
<li><b>WG-60834</b> Added a new <b>OriginalsSubFolder</b> column header to tab-delimited import.</li>
<li><b>WG-61101</b> (WAAPI) Added <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_log_additem.html">ak.wwise.core.log.addItem</a> and <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_log_clear.html">ak.wwise.core.log.clear</a> for logging.</li>
<li><b>WG-61119</b> Inspecting the Audio Device now includes Meter and Effects bottom tabs like the other objects. The Bus also includes a bottom tab for the Meter. The meter view can now be set to pinned mode, allowing more than 4 meters with different objects being metered.</li>
<li><b>WG-61181</b> Added the Audio Device Meter view. It appears at the bottom of the Object Tab when selecting an Audio Device. This meter view replaces the meters that were previously integrated in the Audio Device Editor.</li>
<li><b>WG-61312</b> You can now resize Soundcaster lists.</li>
<li><b>WG-61374</b> Replaced the Property Editor with an Object Tab in the Voice Profiler layout to display objects' properties.</li>
<li><b>WG-61962</b> Multiple threads are now shared for audio file analysis and WEM generation.</li>
<li><b>WG-61965</b> (WAAPI) Added argument autoCheckOutToSourceControl to <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_ui_project_open.html">ak.wwise.ui.project.open</a>.</li>
<li><b>WG-62000</b> (Spatial Audio) Improved path calculation for higher-order diffraction paths. Paths across multiple edges are now optimized to find the shortest possible path, resulting in a more accurate diffraction coefficient.</li>
<li><b>WG-62069</b> Added new shortcut menus to the Music Segment Editor to convert Music Tracks to Music Subtracks.</li>
<li><b>WG-62096</b> (WAAPI) Introduced the keyword "as" in the return options to allow an alias to be used in the returned object.</li>
<li><b>WG-62097</b> (WAAPI) Added new functions in the return options to work on objects lists, such as: first, last, count, at, etc.</li>
<li><b>WG-62153</b> (WAAPI) Added support to import plug-in media sources through <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_core_object_set.html">ak.wwise.core.object.set</a>.</li>
<li><b>WG-62630</b> Wwise can now compute in which room a game object is located.</li>
<li><b>WG-62838</b> "Push All Modified Objects" mode now synchronizes all modifications to the project upon connection to the game, even for changes made in a prior session. When SoundBanks are loaded after connecting, further synchronization occurs as needed.</li>
<li><b>WG-63206</b> (WAAPI) Added support for retrieving the Loaded Media information from profiling data.</li>
<li><b>WG-63256</b> (WAAPI) Added support for retrieving the CPU usage information from profiling data.</li>
<li><b>WG-63257</b> (WAAPI) Added support for retrieving Performance Monitor counter information from profiling data.</li>
<li><b>WG-63492</b> (WAAPI) Added new utility function <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_debug_generatetonewav.html">ak.wwise.debug.generateToneWAV</a> to generate test WAV files.</li>
<li><b>WG-63507</b> Using a geometry that is not watertight for the definition of a room now produces an error message.</li>
<li><b>WG-63574</b> Added information to the Project Migration dialog to support source control during migration.</li>
<li><b>WG-64050</b> (Spatial Audio) Reflections can now propagate seamlessly through portals. Reflections might occur on either side of a portal, as well as in intermediate rooms between two portals.</li>
<li><b>WG-64094</b> (WAAPI) Added support for retrieving the Streamed Media information from profiling data.</li>
<li><b>WG-64095</b> (Spatial Audio) The new Reverb Zones feature allows you to assign a distinct reverb effect to a specified region inside a Room. A Reverb Zone is a new type of Room, allowing for sound propagation between Rooms without the need for portals. Reverb Zones are particularly useful for spaces not easily delineated by walls, such as covered areas, balconies, and various outdoor environments. Two new API functions have been added to manage Reverb Zones: <code>AK::SpatialAudio::SetReverbZone</code> and <code>AK::SpatialAudio::RemoveReverbZone</code>.</li>
<li><b>WG-64118</b> (WAAPI) Added the following new functions related to mute/solo:<ul>
<li>ak.wwise.core.audio.mute</li>
<li>ak.wwise.core.audio.solo</li>
<li>ak.wwise.core.audio.resetMute</li>
<li>ak.wwise.core.audio.resetSolo</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>WG-64159</b> Added a Room ID column in the Game Object List in the Game Object 3D Viewer.</li>
<li><b>WG-64180</b> (WAAPI) You can now omit the project argument when starting a WAAPI server using WwiseConsole.</li>
<li><b>WG-64194</b> (WAAPI) Added <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_ui_project_create.html">ak.wwise.ui.project.create</a> and <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_console_project_create.html">ak.wwise.console.project.create</a> to create and load a new project using WAAPI.</li>
<li><b>WG-64250</b> Improved graph drawing to give more space to the area where curves appear.</li>
<li><b>WG-64411</b> Added support for object lists (Effects, RTPC, etc.) in the List View.</li>
<li><b>WG-64882</b> Height channels now get 3D spatialized instead of being dropped.</li>
<li><b>WG-65095</b> Loudness Normalization is now more configurable: a loudness target can be set (with a default value of -23 corresponding to the target from prior releases), and it is now possible to normalize based on the Momentary Max value instead of Integrated, which is usually a better fit for short sound effects. The measured loudness values are also now available as columns in the List View and can be queried using WAAPI and WAQL.</li>
<li><b>WG-65100</b> Added four User Layouts so you can create custom layouts to suit your workflows.</li>
<li><b>WG-65118</b> Added GetProjectLicenseID to the <code>AK::Wwise::Plugin::Host</code> service, which has been updated to version 2.</li>
<li><b>WG-65177</b> Clicking or dragging anywhere in the Source Editor's timeline ruler now sets the play cursor time. When dragging the cursor, the time is displayed in a tooltip.</li>
<li><b>WG-65191</b> When using the Recorder Effect in Wwise Authoring, you can now include "%s" in the <b>Authoring Tool Output Path</b> to add a date and time string to the filename. With this, each invocation of the Recorder Effect creates a new file, instead of reusing the same filename and overwriting the contents.</li>
<li><b>WG-65226</b> Added an option to display transition zones in the 3D viewer.</li>
<li><b>WG-65437</b> Added platform argument to *.project.create WAAPI functions. This new argument allows you to indicate the platform(s) supported by the new project.</li>
<li><b>WG-66122</b> Error messages are now shown on project load when files under .cache are read-only.</li>
<li><b>WG-66350</b> Waveforms are now shown by default in the List View for Sound SFX objects.</li>
<li><b>WG-66562</b> Added support for Effect lists in the Multi Editor.</li>
<li><b>WG-66725</b> In Wwise Project Settings, you can now specify the line ending (LF vs. CRLF) applied when saving project and SoundBank files.</li>
<li><b>WG-67403</b> You can now open the Attenuation Editor from the Positioning tab of the Property Editor even when <b>Override parent</b> is not selected.</li>
<li><b>WG-67559</b> Added the experimental Live Media Transfer feature. Refer to User Preferences for details on enabling it.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="generic_api_changes_2023_1"></a>
API Changes</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>WG-53660</b> Sound Engine nodes (audio, bus, and output device) now support up to 255 Effects. You can use the following functions to set an Effect on slots 0-254 (parameter in_uFXIndex):<ul>
<li><code>AK::SoundEngine::SetActorMixerEffect</code></li>
<li><code>AK::SoundEngine::SetBusEffect</code></li>
<li><code>AK::SoundEngine::SetOutputDeviceEffect</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>WG-61084</b> Removed <code>IAkMixerInputContext</code> from <code><a class="el" href="struct_ak_speaker_volume_matrix_callback_info.html">AkSpeakerVolumeMatrixCallbackInfo</a></code> due to the Mixer plug-in removal.</li>
<li><b>WG-61344</b> Removed the AK_SCHEDULER_BLOCKING scheduler type flag and the related IAkIOHookBlocking interface. IAkIOHookDeferredBatch is now the only low-level I/O hook interface.</li>
<li><b>WG-62665</b> Moved function <code>OutputSearchedPaths</code> from <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_file_location_resolver.html">AK::StreamMgr::IAkFileLocationResolver</a></code> to <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_low_level_i_o_hook.html">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook</a></code>.</li>
<li><b>WG-63463</b> Corrected typo in error code name "AK_CannotAddItseflAsAChild."</li>
<li><b>WG-63988</b> Changed the return value of <code>EstimateHFDamping()</code> from AKRESULT to AkReal32 and it now directly returns the HF Damping value. Removed the argument __ AkReal32 out_hfDamping.</li>
<li><b>WG-64048</b> (Spatial Audio) Added <code>AkSpatialAudioInitSettings::uMaxEmitterRoomAuxSends</code> to limit the maximum number of game-defined auxiliary sends that can originate from a single emitter.</li>
<li><b>WG-64966</b> Removed <code>AkMemSettings::bUseDeviceMemAlways</code> in favor of a new setting, <code>AkMemSettings::bEnableSeparateDeviceHeap</code>. <code>AkMemSettings::bEnableSeparateDeviceHeap</code> makes it easier to use just one generic memory heap. If you had <code>AkMemSettings::bUseDeviceMemAlways</code> set to true, you should instead set <code>AkMemSettings::bEnableSeparateDeviceHeap</code> to false, and the custom memory hooks you had set for <code>AkMemSettings::AllocDeviceVM</code> and <code>AkMemSettings::FreeDeviceVM</code> should instead be set for <code>AkMemSettings::AllocVM</code> and <code>AkMemSettings::FreeVM</code>.</li>
<li><b>WG-65130</b> (Spatial Audio) Removed <code>AkGeometryParams::EnableTriangles</code> and replaced it with <code>AkGeometryInstanceParams::UseForReflectionAndDiffraction</code>.</li>
<li><b>WG-65303</b> Simplified <code><a class="el" href="class_a_k_1_1_stream_mgr_1_1_i_ak_low_level_i_o_hook.html">AK::StreamMgr::IAkLowLevelIOHook</a></code> interface:<ul>
<li>I/O functions no longer have to provide a return value.</li>
<li>Callbacks now only have to be fired for each individual operation and must always be called without exception.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>WG-65602</b> (Spatial Audio) Changed the default values of <a class="el" href="struct_ak_spatial_audio_init_settings.html" title="Initialization settings of the spatial audio module.">AkSpatialAudioInitSettings</a> to support the ongoing evolution of Spatial Audio. The default settings are a good starting point for most projects. You will need to review and adjust them as necessary to find a balance between performance and quality for your specific product and platform.</li>
<li><b>WG-66128</b> (Spatial Audio) The use of <code>AkGeometryInstanceParams::RoomID</code> is now deprecated and the parameter will be removed in a future version. We recommend that you do not use RoomID and instead leave it set to the default value (-1).</li>
<li><b>WG-66185</b> Added new SDK function <code>AK::SoundEngine::IsPluginRegistered</code>.</li>
<li><b>WG-66667</b> The sample functions for <code>AKPLATFORM::AllocVM</code> and <code>AKPLATFORM::FreeVM</code>, as well as some other virtual memory-related functions and definitions, have been moved from AkPlatformFuncs.h to AkMemoryMgrFuncs.h. Because of these changes, it might be necessary to modify or add to some header inclusions in code to resolve compiler errors.</li>
<li><b>WG-67001</b> Added size member to <code><a class="el" href="struct_ak_marker_callback_info.html">AkMarkerCallbackInfo</a></code>, added size argument to <code>AddOutputCaptureMarker</code>, and fixed display of concurrent markers in Wwise Wave Viewer.</li>
<li><b>WG-67058</b> Moved the core types for AK_SIMD from <code>AkSimd.h</code> to <code>AkSimdTypes.h</code>. You might need to modify some header inclusions in code to resolve compilation errors.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="generic_behavior_changes_2023_1"></a>
Behavior Changes</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>WG-31188</b> The .akd file contents have been moved to a database inside the project's .cache folder. Existing .akd files can be deleted.</li>
<li><b>WG-47959</b> Arguments given to WwiseConsole that interact with an existing project are now relative to the console's current working directory instead of the project's directory.</li>
<li><b>WG-59985</b> Command add-ons using the redirectOutput option now start a process with a hidden window.</li>
<li><b>WG-61331</b> In the Voice Monitor <b>Bus</b> field, <b>Master Audio Bus</b> is now selected by default.</li>
<li><b>WG-61333</b> Spatial Audio rays are now expanded by default in the Contribution List of the Voice Inspector. Right-click the Contribution List to disable this functionality using the new <b>Auto Expand Spatial Audio</b> option.</li>
<li><b>WG-61770</b> Improved the ray tracing engine by continuously casting a small number of rays. The casting of rays no longer depends on the motion threshold setting (see <a class="el" href="struct_ak_spatial_audio_init_settings.html">AkSpatialAudioInitSettings</a>). Rays are no longer cleared between calls to the ray tracing engine. Instead, they are kept until they become invalid. Casting rays continuously better distributes the CPU load among frames, reducing CPU spikes. And the default number of primary rays has been lowered to 10.</li>
<li><b>WG-62723</b> Creating a Sound SFX from the Project Explorer shortcut menu using a source plug-in now brings focus to the object name first and then to the Object Tab, similar to all other newly created objects.</li>
<li><b>WG-62888</b> AK Convolution Reverb IR can now be updated when Wwise is connected to a game without regenerating SoundBanks.</li>
<li><b>WG-63600</b> List search filter is now visible by default in the Multi Editor, the Keyboard Shortcuts and Commands dialog, and the Object Property Settings dialog of the List View.</li>
<li><b>WG-64024</b> (Wwise Console) The <code>project</code> argument is now optional for the <a class="el" href="ak_wwise_cli_waapiserver.html">waapi-server</a> operation.</li>
<li><b>WG-64046</b> (Spatial Audio) Portal spread calculation now takes into account the listener's angle away from the front of a portal.</li>
<li><b>WG-64358</b> In the options dialogs for the Capture Log, Game Object 3D Viewer, and Audio Object 3D Viewer, moved Reset button from lower-right corner to lower-left corner to avoid confusion with typical placement of cancel buttons.</li>
<li><b>WG-64817</b> The Wwise toolbar now displays the name of the task running in the background if there is only one task. Otherwise, the number of tasks in execution and on hold is displayed.</li>
<li><b>WG-65038</b> (Spatial Audio) Geometric transmission loss now overrides room transmission loss if geometry is available to a room. Previously, Spatial Audio took the maximum of the geometric (surface) transmission loss and the room transmission loss values. However, this made it problematic to have a room with mixed transmissive and opaque surfaces. Having such a room would necessitate setting the room transmission loss value to the lowest surface transmission loss value, which would then make the reverb and room tones fully audible. By ignoring the room transmission loss value when geometry is available, the room transmission loss can now be set to a representative average and can be used effectively for reverb spatialization and room tone transmission simulation.</li>
<li><b>WG-65089</b> When using <code>SetObjectObstructionAndOcclusion()</code> with Spatial Audio, the obstruction and occlusion values are now only sent to the direct path.</li>
<li><b>WG-65361</b> When changing the acoustic texture associated with an image source across two frames, the output signal of the Reflect plug-in now ducks and fades back in. Previously, only the contribution of the image source was affected, but in a harsher way. Note, the recommended way to handle the real-time swap of acoustic textures is to use a different image source ID.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="generic_perf_changes_2023_1"></a>
Performance Changes</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>WG-53649</b> Converted the Parametric EQ Effect from an In-Place Effect to an In-Place Object Processor. This means it is now instantiated only once per Audio Objects bus, as opposed to once per Audio Object. This saves some memory and significantly improves performance. For example, when running on an Audio Objects bus with many single-channel Audio Objects, the throughput performance should increase by up to a factor of four. Note that even though it is now considered an Object Processor, there are no other notable changes to the behavior or functionality.</li>
<li><b>WG-57311</b> Reduced the number of small memory allocations made by Spatial Audio.</li>
<li><b>WG-59366</b> The Source Control status icons of Work Units are now fetched asynchronously, which speeds up project loading and some source control operations. The Refresh Icons command is also faster.</li>
<li><b>WG-61576</b> Significantly improved performance of Event Actions such as Stop All, Pause All, Seek All, and Resume All, among others. Spikes in CPU usage that were seen with the use of these actions will be mostly eliminated.</li>
<li><b>WG-62148</b> Slightly improved performance when doing RMS metering of audio data.</li>
<li><b>WG-65815</b> Audio metadata of Originals files are now persistently cached, so that running Queries based on Audio Source duration or channel count, or generating the "Estimated Duration" metadata during SoundBank generation, now run much faster. After the cache has been populated, these operations on large projects now only take a few seconds to run, instead of several minutes.</li>
<li><b>WG-66168</b> It's no longer necessary to associate geometries with Rooms to improve CPU performance.</li>
<li><b>WG-66253</b> Audio buffers for mixing busses are now cleared at the start of their respective mixing operations instead of during <code>CAkLEngine::ReleaseBuffersAndFeedbackAsync</code>. This eliminates most of the cost of <code>CAkLEngine::ReleaseBuffersAndFeedbackAsync</code>.</li>
<li><b>WG-66254</b> The function used for conversion from decibels to linear gains now returns an exact result of 1.0f for an input of 0.0f, instead of 0.999039. Some optimizations that try to save on the application of gains can now check for results of 1.0f more reliably, making their results more relevant. An example of this is reducing the overhead of Audio Objects.</li>
<li><b>WG-66256</b> The 3D Audio Mixer Effect, and final mix-and-triage of Objects for 3D Audio devices, now perform a simpler mixdown when the source and destination buffers have the same configuration.</li>
<li><b>WG-66258</b> The audio format of original files is now persisted in a local database for faster access during Wwise Authoring operations.</li>
<li><b>WG-67234</b> Significantly improved the performance of Audio Objects busses in many situations. Metadata and audio data for Audio Objects no longer create separate memory allocations, or perform copies of the data, when there is only one output connection from a source bus to a destination bus that is processing as Audio Objects. Busses that have multiple output connections due to aux sends or because they are attached to a multi-positioned game object with listener-relative routing still require separate copies of data.</li>
<li><b>WG-67320</b> Integrated a new memory allocation system, "Temp Alloc", into the sound engine specifically for handling allocations that are only applicable for a single audio-render tick. This is used for audio buffers for audio busses, as well as metadata for audio objects. In most cases, this greatly reduces the number of memory allocations performed during audio rendering, improves performance in some multi-threaded scenarios, and slightly reduces fragmentation of memory pools used for audio processing. For more information on how to tune and manage this new system, refer to Tuning "Temp Alloc" Memory. Note that as a part of this change, it is no longer possible for "Feedback" connections in the Voice Graph to be consumed by Audio Objects busses. This use case could create many other subtle and fatal issues, so it is no longer supported. Applications that create feedback scenarios due to Wwise Spatial Audio or other tools for handling audio propagation, must ensure that the destination busses of any feedback connections are mixing busses instead.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="generic_misc_2023_1"></a>
Miscellaneous Changes</h1>
