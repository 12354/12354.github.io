<div class="textblock"><p>Real-time Parameter Controls (RTPCs) enable you to control specific properties of various Wwise objects (including sounds, containers, control busses, effects, and so on) in real time based on real-time parameter changes that occur within the game.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how RTPCs can be used in your games:</p><ul>
<li>In a racing game, you can control the volume and pitch of a car's engine sounds based on the speed of the car and RPM of the engine.</li>
<li>In a ski or snowboard game, the sounds generated by the skis can change with speed and angle.</li>
<li>In a game that is located in an outdoors environment, you can tweak the parameters of an effect based on wind speed.</li>
<li>In a game where some sounds should be randomly positioned across the speakers, RTPCs on the left-right and front-rear panning of 3D user-defined sounds can be driven by your own random positioning code, instead of using pre-defined paths created in Wwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are of course just a few examples, and the possibilities are endless. Whenever an audio object's property should be affected by what happens in a game, RTPCs can be used.</p>
<p>The Wwise user defines the name and range of game parameters in Wwise, in the Game Syncs tab of the Project Explorer. RTPC curves are also defined by the Wwise user in the RTPC tab of the Property Editor or Effect Editor. The value of a game parameter represents the X axis of an RTPC curve. The actual value of the property is computed by evaluating the curve at the X value that corresponds to the game parameter's current value.</p>
<p>Once game parameters and RTPC curves have been defined by the sound designer in Wwise, the game simply needs to update the value of the various game parameters while the game is being played. The sound engine computes the property's value by evaluating the RTPC curve for the current value of the game parameter.</p>
<p>Refer to the Wwise documentation for more information regarding RTPC from the sound designer's point of view.</p>
<p>Refer to <a class="el" href="soundengine_rtpc.html">Integration Details - RTPCs</a> for an overview of how to integrate RTPCs in your game. </p>
