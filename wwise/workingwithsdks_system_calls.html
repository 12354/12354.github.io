<div class="textblock"><p>Almost all operating systems have callbacks or notifications for the following events:</p><ul>
<li>Pressing Home button</li>
<li>Putting application in background/foreground</li>
<li>Starting/stopping user music</li>
</ul>
<p>These events are not handled automatically by Wwise. The main reason is that some of the OS APIs don't allow multiple callbacks or notification receivers. Therefore, the Wwise SDK needs to be told of those events to avoid "eating" those events instead of the game.</p>
<p>For information on how to handle user-music replacements, please read <a class="el" href="background_music_and_dvr.html">Handling User Music (BGM) and DVR</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="system_calls_background"></a>
Application in Background/Foreground</h1>
<p>In general, all game systems can put the application in the background for a time. Wwise can have three possible behaviors, depending on your preferences or the platform's requirements:</p><ul>
<li>Suspend all audio rendering: Call AK::SoundEngine::Suspend(false) to do so.</li>
<li>Partially suspend (keep processing events, but don't render audio): Call AK::SoundEngine::Suspend(true). This is useful if your game still runs and sends calls to the sound engine.</li>
<li>Continue to play audio: There's nothing to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, when the application is put in the background and Suspend(false) is used, the game should not call any of the sound engine APIs. Posting events and such would work, but would accumulate and be played all at the same time when the system would be awoken. To resume the audio processing, call AK::SoundEngine::WakeupFromSuspend() followed by a call to RenderAudio() when receiving the proper notification from the system. You may queue up other events before calling RenderAudio().</p>
<p>You should read about each platform's requirements in the manufacturer's documentation to choose the right behavior.</p>

Windows</h2>
<p>HWND is the handle of the window associated with the audio. Each game must specify the HWND of the application for device detection purposes. The value returned by GetDefaultPlatformInitSettings is the foreground HWND at the moment of the initialization of the sound engine and might not be the correct one for your game. Each game must provide the correct HWND to use.</p>
